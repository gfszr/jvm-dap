# jvm-dap

This is a work-in-progress project towards implementing a JVM debugger that implements the [Debug
Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol). 

Although there are already great alternatives out there, this project intends to be a simple and
low-footprint adapter, which can start fast and run on any reasonable JVM.
